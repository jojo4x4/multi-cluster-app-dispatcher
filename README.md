# Multi Cluster App Dispatcher

The multi cluster app wrapper `multi-cluster-app-dispatcher` is a controller to manage batch jobs in Kubernetes, providing mechanisms for applications which would like to run batch jobs leveraging Kubernetes. 

`multi-cluster-app-dispatcher` is capable of (i) providing an abstraction for wrapping all resources of the job/application and treating them holistically, (ii) queuing job/application creation requests and applying different queuing policies, e.g., FIFO, Priority, (iii) dispatching the job to one of multiple clusters, where a queuing agent runs, using configurable dispatch policies, and (iv) auto-scaling pod sets, balancing job demands and cluster availability (future work).

Refer to [deployment](deployment/deployment.md) on how to deploy `multi-cluster-app-wrapper` as in Kubernetes.

Refer to [tutorial](doc/usage/tutorial.md) on how to use `kube-batch` to run batch job in Kubernetes
